##Hello everybody, 
I'm Diego. I recently changed careers: from architect to programmer! I started programming out of curiosity, trying to apply it to architecture, and eventually decided to switch. What I like about programming is its potential connection with any discipline, solving different types of problems, the logic, the fact that design is involved... I like to think that with just my computer, I can create a product that can be useful.

Currently, I’m deepening my knowledge of JavaScript, with React and NextJS, by working on personal projects — you can check them out in my repositories! But I didn’t just learn frontend; backend excites me too, and I use Express and Koa, usually with Mongo.
At the same time, I keep practicing with Leetcode to enhance my problem-solving skills. Another technology I also use to exercise and just for fun is P5.js!

I'm a curious person by nature: I love science (from biology to physics, including chemistry) because I enjoy understanding why things happen. I’m also passionate about art, especially cinema and graphic arts.
